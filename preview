The objective of this project is to simulate the collection of streaming sensor data from an IoT environment. By creating a realistic simulation, the project aims to replicate real-world challenges and provide an opportunity for practitioners to gain hands-on experience with managing big data. Throughout the project, various tools and technologies will be explored to handle and analyze the data, allowing for the introduction of a typical procedure for effectively managing large datasets. The ultimate goal is to provide a practical learning experience while showcasing different tools and the best practices for managing big data in an IoT context.
